# Aluminium Extrusion Die Design Knowledge Graph Instruction








## Preface

This Knowledge Graph（KG） focuses on die design optimisation in the aluminium extrusion process, a significant industry that contributes more than 40% of the market capitalization in metal-forming processes. Because traditional die designs are imprecise and heavily rely on past experiences and analogy engineering, they constantly lead to longer development cycles. By compiling information from multiple engineering standards and existing die designs, a comprehensive KG that captures the essence of our understanding of aluminium extrusion die design will be created.

This instruction will introduce the main functions of KG and explain in detail how to use it. I hope you find this product helpful :>
